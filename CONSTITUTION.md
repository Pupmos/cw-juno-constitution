![](https://i.imgur.com/xYgAhqv.png)

This document defines rights and protection for delegates, validators and non-delegates. Furthermore**,** it imposes rules on SubDAOs (appointed organizations). These rules provide fundamental protection **for** delegates as well as non-delegates.

The Juno Constitution sets unbendable standards (unless amended by a supermajority) for governance of the Juno distributed ledger (see articles below). It serves as the starting point for the Juno Constitution and frames the constitutional genesis via articles 1.0-7.0. The Juno Constitution does not act upon or enforce past or open disputes related to pre-/genesis claims prior to this constitutional inception.
> []Consider "resolute" instead of "unbendable"

The Juno Commonwealth ie. delegates & validators shall have the power to interpret this Constitution, apply such interpretations to particular circumstances, and adopt policies in furtherance of such interpretations, provided that all such actions are reasonable and consistent.

### Article 1.0: Members of the Juno Commonwealth

The Juno Commonwealth is comprised of the Juno public distributed ledger, which includes validators (public nodes), delegates (bonded Juno) and non-delegates (unbonded Juno).

Juno is open to all persons, without arbitrary discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, or otherwise.

### Article 2.0: Definition of the Juno Commonwealth

The Juno Commonwealth is a globally distributed commons ie. not bound to any specific legal jurisdiction. Nevertheless, individual validators, delegates and non-delegates are subject to their specific local jurisdictions and regulations.

### Article 3.0: Application of the Constitution

The Constitution applies to the Juno public distributed ledger, including delegates, validators and non-delegates.

### Article 4.0: Decision Making via On-chain Governance

Social consensus (Delegate ruling) via on-chain governance shall be the unbendable standard (unless amended by a supermajority) for decision-making related to the Juno distributed ledger.

### Article 5.0: Sanctity of Private Accounts

No private account on the Juno ledger shall be deprived of liberty or property by on-chain governance, nor shall private property be taken from private accounts for public use.

A private account is any account on the Juno blockchain that is not explicitly created and administered by Juno Governance. Private accounts can come in many different forms, including but not limited to: cryptographic keypairs, smart contracts, networking ports, and cosmos-sdk modules.

#### Appendix 5.1

Accounts explicitly created by Juno on-chain governance as branches of Juno on-chain governance are subject to the controls decided upon at the time of creation.

#### Appendix 5.2

The vested multi-signature account maintaining the Core Infrastructure Development Reserve is a private account. However, a Juno governance supermajority vote maintains emergency powers to redirect un-vested funds allocated for the Juno Core Development Reserve to another private account.

### Article 6.0: Official SubDAOs

Official Juno SubDAOs may be established to make decisions or operate various functions for and on behalf of the Juno Community. Each SubDAO shall be responsible for (i) making decisions within its respective subject area, and (ii) its own operation and maintenance.

Official SubDAOs are fully under the purview of the Juno Community. They do not share the same protections as private accounts as stated in Appendix 5.1. For a SubDAO to be an official SubDAO, full admin control must be given to the Juno Community.

The following principles apply:
 
- SubDAO members are appointees who may be added or removed by a Juno Community or SubDAO vote.
- Decisions made by SubDAOs may be overruled by a Juno Community vote.
- Funds assigned may be recalled with a Juno Community vote.
- SubDAOs can be created or dissolved at any time by a Juno Community vote.


### Article 7.0: Ratification and Amendments

Juno on-chain governance shall make amendments or propose new articles to the constitution if a supermajority (2/3 of present voting power) approves proposed changes.

This Constitution shall only be valid if passed by a supermajority governance ruling.
